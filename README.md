# FluidJetSimulation
A little program simulating a fluid jet.

This little simulation program was just a side project because I wanted to try ComputeSharp and WinUI3.
It should, given the right settings, be able to come very close to reality. I was not able to verify its accuracy.
It simulest multiple particles on the GPU, it also simulates the wind and the slipstream by a simple method.
